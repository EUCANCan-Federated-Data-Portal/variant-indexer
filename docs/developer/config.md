# Config

Configuration for this application is managed through environment variables. 

## Development Env Variables
This application reads configuration variables from the file [`.env`](./../../.env). This file is not included in the git repo and needs to be created by the developer before running the application

[`.env.template`](../../.env.template) is a template for the contents of the `.env` file. The default values provided are defined to connect to the docker containers as defined in the `docker-compose` setup. Many variables are commented out with `#` to start the line - these represent optional variables and you do not need to provide this value to run the application.

> **dotenv**
> 
> The values in the `.env` file are read into `process.env` thanks to the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) library.

### Create .env file
Create a local .env file from the provided template:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

## Env Variables

> **Note**: When a default value is listed here for a required field, this represents the default provided by the template. If you omit this value in your `.env` file the application will not run. Default values in optional fields are provided by the application code in [`src/config.ts`](../../src/config.ts).

## Adding Env Variables

To add a new environment variable to the repository requires making the following changes:
1. Add the new environment variable to the [.env.template](../../.env.template) template
1. Add a new property to the global config in [/src/config.ts](../../src/config.ts) that will read from the new property.
1. Add the new variable to the Env Variables table in this document. 

If the variable is required, you will also need to update your `.env` file with the new variable.

### Updating the .env Template

When adding new variables to the .env template, please follow these rules:

  1. Keep the template organized by grouping related variables together in the template. Use headers to describe each group to help developers navigate the .env file.
  1. Required variables must include a default value that will work for a new developer running this application.
  1. Optional variables should be commented out and should include the default value used by the application.

The objective of the .env template is to provide a starting point for new developers. If configured correctly, a new developer should be able to run the application from source using a copy of this template and the docker-compose described services. In order to maintain this, default values in the template the direct to external resources should be written to connect to the docker-compose services.

### Adding Config Properties

Environment variables are all read into a global config object in the [/src/config.ts](../../src/config.ts) file. This is the entry point for environment variables into the source code. 

An [envUtils library](../../src/utils/envUtils.ts) is included in this repo to enforce type safety of environment variables on application startup. Looking at the existing config properties should give a good guide for how to use this library. This library will validate that the provided environment variable matches the provided type information, including if it is required or not, and throw an error if the provided value is not valid. This will prevent the application from starting if the `.env` variables do not match expectations for the application.

When adding new config properties, please use the `envUtils` library.

The library will create a variable validator from the name of the env variable:

```ts
env('VARIABLE_NAME')
```


By default, all variables are optional, you need to declare the type you expect the variable to be (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`) with a default value if the value is not provided:

```ts
env('VARIABLE_NAME').string('default');
env('VARIABLE_NAME').number(123);
env('VARIABLE_NAME').boolean(false);
```

If you need the variable to be provided in the `.env` file, chain the `.required()` function and no default value will be used:

```ts
env('VARIABLE_NAME').required().string();
```

You can require that the value provided is within a list of allowed values using the `.options()` method:

```ts
env('VARIABLE_NAME').options(['A','B','C']).string('C'); // If a value is provided it must be from the list otherwise an error is thrown. If no value is provided, this will default to `C`
env('VARIABLE_NAME').options(['1','2','3']).number(1); // provided value must match a string, but can be parsed into a number
env('VARIABLE_NAME').required().options(['A','B','C']).string(); // a value is required and must be in the list of options
```

Lastly, you can transform a value into a boolean using the `.matches()` method:

```ts
env('VARIABLE_NAME').matches('hello'); // returns true if the environment variable matched `hello`, otherwise false. If no value is provided it will return false. 
env('VARIABLE_NAME').required().matches('hello'); // If no value is provided this throws an error, otherwise we check if the value matches `hello`
```


### Adding Env Variables to this Document

Please document all environment variables used by the application.
