# Docker Compose

A [`docker-compose`](../../docker-compose.yaml) file has been provided to allow developers to run local instances of all services that the indexer connects to.

## Makefile

The makefile includes scripts to simplify the prepare docker environment. 

Run `make up` to start all docker containers through docker-compose. Similarly, `make down` will stop all containers. 

Reference the [`Makefile`](makefile.md) documentation for more control scripts available.

## Containers
